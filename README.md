## PedalBrain

### `The smart brain for my every bike ride.`

#### Description

#### PedalBrain is a realtime cycling computer that connects your bike's sensors, processes ride data, and gives actionable insights - all while managing deadlines and events intelligently. This Soft-Realtime Cycling Computer is designed to work in Linux Userspace with near RealTime efficiency, being centralised and process data from multiple sensors, including BLE devices, GPS and environmental sensors.

#### Designed and Developed as a Personal Project for I am a cyclist who wants a smarter, connected and fully aware ride-experience (with the classic developer's mindset who fell victim to `I think I can build this thing better for free, instead of buying the product or getting a subscription` )
